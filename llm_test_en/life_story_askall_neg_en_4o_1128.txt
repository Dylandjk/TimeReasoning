Let's break down the timeline based on the information provided:

Jack's life events:
Started elementary school in 1907.
Graduated from elementary school in 1913 (6 years after starting elementary school).
Started junior high school 6 years after starting elementary school, i.e., 1913 + 6 = 1919.
Graduated from junior high school 4 years after graduating from elementary school, i.e., 1913 + 4 = 1917.
Started high school in 1917.
Graduated from high school 3 years after starting high school, i.e., 1917 + 3 = 1920.
Joined a company 14 years after starting junior high school, i.e., 1919 + 14 = 1933.
Started dating 22 years after starting elementary school, i.e., 1907 + 22 = 1929.
Spent 0 years dating (indicating he started and ended dating at the same time).
Retired 55 years after starting elementary school, i.e., 1907 + 55 = 1962.
Now let's analyze the options:

A: The time gap between he joined a company and joined a company is 35 year(s).

This statement is nonsensical, as it repeats the same event (joining the company). There is no gap between joining a company and joining a company. Thus, A is incorrect.
B: He joined a company after he graduated from junior high school.

Jack joined a company in 1933, which is 14 years after he started junior high school in 1919. He graduated junior high school in 1917, which means he joined a company after graduating from junior high school. Thus, B is correct.
C: He graduated from junior high school before he joined a company.

Jack graduated from junior high school in 1917, and he joined the company in 1933, which is 16 years later. Thus, C is correct.
D: There are 13 year(s) between he started elementary school and graduated from high school.

Jack started elementary school in 1907 and graduated from high school in 1920, which is a gap of 13 years (1920 - 1907 = 13). Thus, D is correct.
Conclusion:
The incorrect statement is A.
