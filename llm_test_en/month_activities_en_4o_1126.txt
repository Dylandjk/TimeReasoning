Let's break down the events based on the timeline provided:

Started an overseas trip (3 months after starting to write the novel)
Ended the overseas trip (4 months after starting to write the novel)
Published his own novel (3 months after starting the overseas trip)
Attended a concert (5 months after starting to write the novel)
Ended the journal of the year (3 months after starting the overseas trip)
Won the lottery (1 month after attending the concert)
Attended a class reunion (3 months after starting the overseas trip)
Now, we are asked to determine what happened before he published his own novel.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

B: started an overseas trip.

Let's break down the events based on the information provided:

Started writing a novel (June)
Wrote the novel for 6 months
Had an overseas trip for 1 month before October
Attended a concert 2 months after starting the overseas trip
Ended the journal of the year 6 months after starting to write the novel
Won the lottery in December
Attended a class reunion 6 months after starting to write the novel (which would be December)
Now, we need to figure out which event has a 2-month difference between it and the class reunion. Since the class reunion happened in December (6 months after starting the novel), let's check the events that occurred 2 months before December.

Attended a concert: This happened 2 months after starting the overseas trip. Based on the timeline, the overseas trip occurred before October, and the concert happened 2 months after that. If the concert was in October, then the concert is 2 months before December.
Therefore, the correct answer is:

D: attended a concert.

He has a 2-month difference between attending a concert and attending a class reunion.

Published his own novel (6 months after starting to write the novel, so in December)
Started an overseas trip (September)
Had an overseas trip for 1 month (September to October)
Attended a concert (in November)
Ended the journal of this year (3 months after starting the overseas trip, so in December)
Won the lottery (6 months after starting to write the novel, so in December)
Attended a class reunion (2 months after ending the overseas trip, so in December)
Now, the question asks about the 3-month difference between an event and attending a class reunion. Since the class reunion happened in December, we need to look for an event that occurred 3 months before December.

Started an overseas trip: This was in September. 3 months before December is September.
Attended a class reunion: This is the event we are comparing the difference to, so this does not answer the question.
Published his own novel: This happened in December, so it's not 3 months before.
Won the lottery: This happened in December, so it's not 3 months before.
From the options, the event that happened 3 months before attending the class reunion (which is in December) is:

A: started an overseas trip.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

A: started an overseas trip.

There are 3 months between starting an overseas trip and attending a class reunion.
