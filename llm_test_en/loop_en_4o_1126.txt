Let's break this down:

Jack learns Japanese on Monday.
2 days after learning Japanese, he has a meeting (on Wednesday).
5 days before the meeting would be 5 days before Wednesday, which is Friday.
Now, we need to figure out what Jack is doing on Friday. From the plan, we know:

He reads essays 5 days after learning Japanese (which is Saturday), so he doesn’t read essays on Friday.
He has a meeting on Wednesday, so he doesn’t have a meeting on Friday.
He cleans his dormitory 3 days after learning Japanese (which is Thursday), so he doesn't clean his dormitory on Friday.
Therefore, 5 days before he has a meeting, he cleans his dormitory.

So, the correct answer is C: cleans his dormitory.

Let's break it down step by step:

Jack learns Japanese on Monday.
1 day before he learns Japanese would be Sunday.
Now, let's see what Jack does on Sunday:

He learns Japanese on Monday, so he doesn't do any of the activities listed on Sunday.
He cleans his dormitory 3 days after learning Japanese, so he cleans it on Thursday.
He reads essays 1 day after practicing the guitar, so that happens on Friday.
He watches movies 3 days after cleaning his dormitory, which is on Sunday, so he watches movies on Sunday.
Therefore, the correct answer is D: watches movies.

He cleans his dormitory on Thursday.
He practices the guitar 1 day after he cleans his dormitory, which means he practices the guitar on Friday.
He reads essays 3 days after his meeting, so he reads essays on Saturday.
1 day after reading essays, he watches movies on Sunday.
Now, we need to find the activity that happens 5 days after Jack practices the guitar (which is on Friday).

If we count 5 days after Friday, that brings us to Wednesday, which is the day he has a meeting.

So, the correct answer is A: has a meeting.

Let's break this down:

Jack learns Japanese on Monday.
He has a meeting on Wednesday.
He cleans his dormitory on Thursday.
He practices the guitar 4 days after learning Japanese, so he practices the guitar on Friday.
He reads essays 3 days after his meeting, so he reads essays on Saturday.
He watches movies 4 days after his meeting, so he watches movies on Sunday.
Now, the question asks: "3 days before he ____ , he has a meeting."

We know that Jack has a meeting on Wednesday. So, 3 days before Wednesday is Sunday. On Sunday, he watches movies.

Thus, the correct answer is D: none of the above is correct, because 3 days before he has a meeting, he watches movies, not any of the other listed activities.
