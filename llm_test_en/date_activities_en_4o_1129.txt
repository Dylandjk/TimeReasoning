Let's break down the timeline:

Before May 11, Jack went on a trip with his friends for 8 days. So, the trip ended before May 11.
May 8: Jack watched the latest released movie.
8 days after May 8: Jack started writing the course paper (May 16).
10 days after May 16: Jack finished writing and submitted the course paper (May 26).
26 days after starting the trip: Jack played computer games for almost an entire day (May 29).
20 days after finishing the trip: Jack finished recording the journal of May (May 31).
May 31: Jack participated in a basketball game.
Now, to answer the question: "____ day(s) before he finished recording the journal of May, he started a trip with friends."

Jack finished recording the journal of May on May 31.
His trip with friends lasted 8 days before May 11, meaning the trip started on May 3.
To find how many days before May 31 the trip started, we calculate the difference between May 31 and May 3, which is 28 days.

So, the correct answer is B: 28.

Let's break down the timeline step by step to determine the answer:

May 3: Jack started a trip with his friends.
May 8: Jack watched the latest released movie (5 days after starting the trip).
May 11: Jack finished the trip with his friends (3 days after watching the movie).
May 16: Jack started writing the course paper (5 days after finishing the trip).
May 18: Jack finished writing and submitted the course paper (18 days after watching the latest released movie).
May 29: Jack played computer games for almost an entire day (18 days after finishing the trip).
May 31: Jack finished recording the journal of May (20 days after finishing the trip).
May 31: Jack participated in a basketball game (23 days after watching the movie).
Now, the question asks: "He started a trip with friends ____ day(s) before he finished writing and submitted the course paper."

Jack finished writing and submitted the course paper on May 18.
He started the trip on May 3, so the difference between May 3 and May 18 is 15 days.
But, looking at the options, none of them matches the 15-day difference directly.

It appears the closest correct interpretation is the difference between May 3 (when the trip started) and May 18 (when the course paper was submitted), which gives 15 days, not exactly matching any answer. Could you check again or provide more information if I missed something?
