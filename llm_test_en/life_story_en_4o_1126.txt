Jack's daughter is telling her friends about the story of his life: He started junior high school, and that was in 1911; In the year of 1915 he graduated from junior high school; In 1915, he started high school; 3 year(s) after he graduated from junior high school, he graduated from high school; He met his future wife, and that was in 1915; In 1918, he started university; The total duration of which he studied in university is 1 year(s) longer than that of he studied in junior high school; He got married 8 year(s) after he started university; 50 year(s) after he met his future wife, he retired.
Please answer: The total duration of which he ____ is longer than that of he studied in junior high school.
A: graduated from high school B: got married C: started university D: studied in university
Answers: D

4o:
The correct answer is D: studied in university.

Here’s the reasoning:

The sentence mentions that the total duration of his university studies is 1 year longer than the duration of his junior high school studies.
The other options (graduated from high school, got married, started university) don’t directly relate to the comparison of duration with his junior high school studies, while "studied in university" directly corresponds to the duration of his university education.
So, the full sentence would read:
"The total duration of which he studied in university is longer than that of he studied in junior high school."

He met his future wife in 1915 and got married 11 years later, which means he got married in 1926 (1915 + 11 years).
Since he retired 50 years after he started high school, this means he retired in 1965 (1915 + 50 years).
So, Jack got married before he retired, making A: got married the correct answer.

Jack's daughter is telling her friends about the story of his life: He studied in junior high school since 1911, for 4 year(s); By 1918, he studied in high school for 3 year(s); In the year of 1915 he met his future wife; He started university 7 year(s) later than he started junior high school; He graduated from university 8 year(s) after he started high school; He got married 8 year(s) later than he graduated from high school; He retired 47 year(s) after he started university.
Please answer: ____ year(s) before he retired, he started junior high school.
A: 45 B: 44 C: 18 D: 54
Answers: D

4o:
The correct answer is B: 44.

Here’s the reasoning:

Jack started junior high school in 1911.

He retired 47 years after he started university.

He started university 7 years later than he started junior high school, which means he started university in 1918 (1911 + 7 years).

He retired 47 years after 1918, so he retired in 1965 (1918 + 47 years).

To find how many years before his retirement he started junior high school, we subtract the year he started junior high school (1911) from the year he retired (1965):

1965 - 1911 = 54 years.

So, 54 years before he retired, he started junior high school.

Therefore, the correct answer should be D: 54.
